# **DyDx**

DyDx is a decentralized exchange (DEX) platform that offers perpetual trading options for over 35 popular cryptocurrencies.  
DyDx is also the most consistent protocol, where gas demands are somewhat similar for both supplying and withdrawing liquidity for most available assets.

## **flashLoan**

DyDx does not natively have a "flashLoan" feature. However it's possible to achieve a similar behavior by executing a series of operations on the SoloMargin contract.
